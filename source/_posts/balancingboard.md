An interactive balancing board using lighting system for 4-6 years old children with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). There are three games that utilizes lighting system around the board which reacted by accelerometer sensor inside the board for increasing concentration and controlling the emotion. The interactivity of this product make the therapy fun, interesting, and more effective. I built electric part for this interactive balancing board. Since it was my friendâ€™s bachelor thesis project (She was a student in Industrial Design major at Institut Teknologi Bandung), I took part in making electrical circuit using accelerometer sensor to sense declivity of the board, using AVR ATMega 32 as microcontroller that process the signal from the sensor, and using LEDs as the display. Beside the electrical part for the interactive board, I also created three games algorithms and implement the algorithms with microcontroller.
