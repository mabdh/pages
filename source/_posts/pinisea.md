The green autonomous water vehicle to track the ocean. Mechanically inspired by "Wave Glider" and has the main purpose to track the fishing spot. It also can use to measure environment condition on the ocean (sea level, temperature, humidity, etc). This project is started since Intel IoT Roadshow Hackathon in Berlin.To track the fishing spot, we use sonar to scan the ground below sea surface. Using many sensors to measure the climate around this boat, we can tell user the condition of the sea. Fisherman simply knows whether it is a good day for fishing or to stay with the family.

This boat has two different parts which are connected together. Top side and bottom side. Top side will measure climate of environment and there are also solar cell to keep the boat flowing. Bottom side will fly underwater and navigate this boat using flaps that are controlled by servo. This boat exploits the energy of wave with measuring the differences between water flow on the surface flow in the water. In this project, I develop the idea, testing and integrating all of sensors that are needed by the boat, and playing around with Intel Edison + Breakout Kit. We got the second place and a prize in this Intel IoT hackathon roadshow.
