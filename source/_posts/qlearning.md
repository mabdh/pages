A snowman lives in a dangerous place. Its home is a tent. However, there are many locations with high intensity radiation. The snowman is going home but it does not know yet which lane are the safest. The algorithm will make snowman decide the most optimal (safest) trajectory to the home (a tent). <!-- more --> 

There are several parameters that can be modified in this simulation.
- Grid Size (Integer)
- Start Point (Integer,Integer) - starting point of the snowman
- Finish Point (Integer,Integer) - location of the tent
- Number of Obstacles per Row (Integer) - At most n obstacles per row. Will be randomized.
- Number of episodes (Integer) - For training purpose. The more episode, the more chance to learn.

Android application Screenshots: 1. Login screen. 2. Initialization screen shows three important locations of the user (home, last location where he activates the insurance for car, and last location where he activates the life insurance). 3. Predictive locations where the risk might occur. The red color shows the highest risk.
