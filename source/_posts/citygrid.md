A city scale version of minesweeper game, created in hackathon #BAJAKJKT, powered by BBH maker lab, nike, and Arduino Verkstadt. This game can be played with more than one player. Beside the box to interact with players, this game also utilise mobile smartphone to guide the players. To play this game, every player should have a mobile smartphone which is installed with City Grid app. In City Grid app, there are several features, city map with the grid (using geotagging with mobile smartphone gps) to inform players position and score information for all players so they can compete and know each other score. The task of every player is to defuse the bom in one section that will be showed in the grid. To defuse the bomb, the player interacts with City Grid box and the box will inform the player and player's phone whether the player failed or not. If the player fails to defuse the bomb, there will be an alarm and the player does not get the score. If the player success to defuse the bomb, there will be information for the next location that the player have to safe by defuse the bomb. I contributed in the idea generation process, designing and making the box-shaped fuse using laser cutter and 3D printer.
