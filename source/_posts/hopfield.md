# Visualizing Hopfield Network

Hopefield Network mimicks how memory works. It is an autoassociative memory which can learn (remember) one or more patterns and given the partial (incomplete) learned pattern (some information of pattern are missing), the network can recall and recover a whole learned pattern.

There are two steps in this application, train and predict.

``Train``
- In this step we will train 3 patterns on the screen
- You can draw the 3 patterns by yourself by clicking the grid
- Or you can use the preset image provided
- Click the Train 3 Patterns button to start training and updating network weights

``Predict``
- In this step we the network will predict the learned pattern once you click the Predict button
- You can draw incomplete pattern similar with the learned pattern in the training phase
- Or you can use the preset image + noise provided
